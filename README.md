# CU-BDA-Assignment 1

**Name:** Seok Hyun Jin  
**Major:** Computer Science  
**Status:** Master of Engineering student (first semester)   

## Motivation for taking the course

My main motivation for taking this course is that I want to understand very clearly what it means
for an approach to be 'Bayesian'. Many courses on machine learning that I have
taken this past year discussed methods that are under the Bayesian framework. Such methods include hierarchical
models, gaussian processes, dirichlet processes and so on. While those courses definitely demonstrated
the strengths of Bayesian methods, I don't think any of them discussed in detail the important
concepts and definitions of the framework.  

By taking this course, I hope to gain a very precise understanding on what makes an approach a Bayesian approach
and be able to revisit previously studied methods armed with this new understanding. Also, I hope to gain
experience in computational methods for making inference (using python or matlab).

## Description of a data analysis problem

A data analysis problem that I have been working on is the problem of enabling robots to become reliable personal
assistants. One of the key requirements for any robot to become a reliable personal assistant is being able
to handle objects that are designed for human use. Because there are so many variations in the human
environment, a rule-based approach is unlikely to generalize effectively. Therefore, we take a data-driven
approach for this problem.

### Image that shows an example of related data

• A description of a data analysis problem or class of problems that interests you. This could be a problem
from a lab course, a thesis project, academic literature in your field, or from the public media.
• Include one image that shows an example of data pertaining to the identified problem. Copy the image
itself into your repo, and use it in your Markdown text. See this StackOverflow question for tips on the
Markdown syntax: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13051428/how-to-display-images-in-markdown-filesof-github
• As you work, commit your work into your local repo multiple times, when you reach natural stopping points
