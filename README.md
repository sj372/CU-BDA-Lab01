## Motivation for taking the course

My main motivation for taking this course is that I want to understand very clearly what it means
for an approach to be 'Bayesian'. In the past year, many courses on machine learning that I have
taken discussed methods that are under the Bayesian framework. Such methods include hierarchical
models, gaussian processes, dirichlet processes and so on. While those courses definitely demonstrated
the strengths of Bayesian methods, I don't think any of them discussed in detail the important
concepts and definitions of the framework.
